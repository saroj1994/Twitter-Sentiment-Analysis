Here is a small code demonstrating the use of keras for applying deep learning architectures to the problem of sentiment analysis of tweets.
The first part of the code is uses classic preprocessing techniques like removing puntuation, lowering the character case, removing short words, stemming.
Then I have used TfIdf vectorizer implementation in SkLearn library to extract feature vectors and is followed by training a Logistic regression 
unit and Stochastic gradient descent. The second part of the code contains basic implementation of deep learning architectures like LSTM and 1dCNN. 
For the purpose of parameter tuning I have used GridCV feature of SkLearn. 
Hope you like the code and do suggest out any further improvements.
